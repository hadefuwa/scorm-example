## Files Built — This Run

### HTML outputs

| File | Source block | Extracted from | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `outputs/html/CP4807-H1.htm` | Homework 1 — Traffic light junction | `outputs/extracted/CP4807-H1.txt` | ✓ Built |

**CP4807-H1.htm** — Homework assignment. Renders as a styled learner-facing HTML page. Contains: covered worksheets list, design brief, hardware pin mapping table (Port A/B traffic light connections), software instructions, timing sequence (RED 20s, AMBER 3s, GREEN 20s), and junction rule. Planning tags and wrapper tags removed. Teacher notes excluded.

### DOCX outputs (built as HTML stand-ins)

> DOCX generation requires python-docx or equivalent. For this prototype run, outputs are produced as styled HTML documents with a build note banner. Content and structure are identical to what a DOCX build would contain.

| File | Source block | Extracted from | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `outputs/docx/CP4807-1.html` | Worksheet 1 — First program | `outputs/extracted/CP4807-1.txt` | ✓ Built |

**CP4807-1.html** — Learner worksheet. Renders as a print-style A4 document. Contains: commands introduced (OUTPUT, LOOP, DELAY), video reference, Over to you instructions, numbered challenge list, hints, and example access instructions. Planning tags and wrapper tags removed.

## Build Warnings

**BW1 — DOCX outputs produced as HTML**
Python-docx is not available in the current environment. DOCX outputs have been produced as styled HTML files with a `.html` extension. The filename convention (`CP4807-1.html`) matches the intended build target filename (`CP4807-1.doc`) for tracking purposes.
To produce genuine `.docx` files, run with python-docx installed or use a Word-compatible conversion step.

### Browser course

Not yet attempted. Requires:
- All 12 learner worksheets extracted and built
- Confirmed course structure and navigation order
- Index page template defined

The Bronze/Silver/Gold structure in the source document suggests a natural three-part navigation structure.

## Recommended Next Step

1. Resolve W2 and W3 in source document.
2. Run full extraction pass.
3. Run full build pass using `prompt-03-build.md`.
4. Run validation using `prompt-04-package-scorm.md` or a dedicated validation prompt.
