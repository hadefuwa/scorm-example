## Summary

| Item | Count |
|---|---|
| Total blocks eligible for extraction | 32 |

> **Prototype note:** This is a partial extraction run. Two blocks have been extracted as real files to validate the pipeline.

### DOCUMENT blocks → `outputs/extracted/` + `outputs/docx/`

| Block | Filename | Extracted text | Built DOCX target | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 32 | `CP4807-CPDcert` *(no ext)* | `outputs/extracted/CP4807-CPDcert.txt` | `outputs/docx/CP4807-CPDcert.html` | Deferred — W3 (missing extension) |

---

## Warnings Carried Forward

All five warnings from `analysis-report.md` remain open. No new warnings from extraction.

| Warning | ID | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Ambiguous double tag on cover page | W1 | Open — treated as worksheet |
| Duplicate filename CP4807-1.doc | W2 | Open — first occurrence deferred |
| Missing extension on CPDcert | W3 | Open — block deferred |
| Curly quotes in filename tags | W4 | Open — no extraction impact |
| Teacher content in HTML blocks | W5 | Open — blocks deferred |

---

## Recommended Next Step

1. Resolve W2 in source document: rename preparation notes block to `CP4807-prep.doc`.
2. Resolve W3: add `.docx` extension to `CP4807-CPDcert` filename tag.
3. Run full extraction pass using `prompt-02-extract.md`.
4. Proceed to build stage using `prompt-03-build.md`.
